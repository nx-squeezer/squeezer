This package provides generators for Nx and Angular to configure a variety of those tools with just a command, integrating without any friction with your existing repo. Check the documentation to see all available features.\nSetup \nExample :npm install --save-dev @nx-squeezer/workspaceRecommended order to setup all the generators:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:prettier\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:eslint\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:tsconfig\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:lint-staged\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:contributors\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:github-workflow\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:codecovGenerators \n\ncodecov\ncommitlint\ncontributors\neslint\ngithub-workflow\nlint-staged\nprettier\ntsconfig\n\ncodecov\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:codecovAdds codecov to a project to have coverage information, including:\n\nGenerating configuration file .codecov.yml.\nConfigures individual projects with test target to expose coverage information.\nUpdates CI file to upload coverage report.\nAdds badge to README.md.\n\ncommitlint\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:commitlintUses commitlint and husky to lint commit messages to adhere to conventional commits. It uses the default configuration provided by @commitlint/config-conventional.\ncontributors\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:contributorsAdds contributors attribution to README.md using contrib.rocks.\neslint\nSetup command, which will prompt one by one the set of rules that can be added:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:eslintAdds a set of ESLint rules to enhance code style in projects. Shipped as a generator instead of a configuration package so that it can be customized and edited by repo, and to automate the configuration of projects with TypeScript. Additionally, since it is an Nx plugin it can automatically apply upgrade changes if needed. The rules that it adds include:\n\neslint:recommended\nsonarjs/recommended\nunused-imports\n@typescript-eslint/recommended\ndeprecation\nimport/recommended\n\ngithub-workflow\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:github-workflowAdds a GitHub Action workflow to automate the CI pipeline for your repo. It includes the following actions:\n\nCheckout.\nSetup Node.\nInstall dependencies.\nTargets for build, test, lint, e2e.\nConfigure nx.json.\nWorkflow adapted to Nx workspaces.\nAdd a badge to README.md.\n\nOptions:\n\nForce overwriting of workflow with --force (default false).\nProvide default branch with --branch=master (default main).\nUse Nx Cloud --useNxCloud (default true).\n\nlint-staged\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:lint-stagedUses lint-staged and husky to lint files when being committed to the repo.\nprettier\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:prettierUpdates prettier configuration with some defaults, and adds prettier/recommended rule to ESLint configuration.\ntsconfig\nSetup command:\nExample :nx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:tsconfigUpdates the tsconfig.json file adding a default configuration with stricter options enabled.\nContributors \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
