It uses the default configuration provided by @commitlint/config-conventional.\ncontributors\nSetup command:\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:contributorsAdds contributors attribution to README.md using contrib.rocks.\neslint\nSetup command, which will prompt one by one the set of rules that can be added:\nnx g @nx-squeezer/workspace:eslintAdds a set of ESLint rules to enhance code style in projects. Shipped as a generator instead of a configuration package so that it can be customized and edited by repo, and to automate the configuration of projects with TypeScript. Additionally, since it is an Nx plugin it can automatically apply upgrade changes if needed.
